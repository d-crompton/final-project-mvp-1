# final-project-mvp-1
This project is the code for my Final Year Project's first Minimum Viable Product - a Home Network Scanner that scans the network for connected devices and allows the user to determine whether they are trusted on not.

To run this program, launch the **Main.py** Python file.

In order for this program to work, you need to have **Nmap** installed (and added to the *Windows PATH variable*) as it is used for the network scanning functionality.
Nmap can be found here - https://nmap.org/download.html

This code was written in Python 3 and uses the following libraries/modules:
* python-nmap - http://xael.org/pages/python-nmap-en.html
* tkinter - https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
* tkinter.messagebox - https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/tkinter.messagebox.html
